# Introduction

A code generator for any language or framework that preserves your changes during regeneration, powered by [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Background

You cannot add code to the generated code because it will be overwritten the next time you generate it.
In real world, code generators are often used to create some boilerplate code (like CRUD operations),
then you develop your own code based on it. However, when you regenerate the code, your changes will be overwritten,
and you have to merge them manually (which is very annoying).

Gencoder is designed to solve this problem. It can recognize which parts of the file are generated
and which parts are manually added. When regenerating, it only overwrites the automatically generated parts,
and the manual parts remain unchanged. No more manual merging.
